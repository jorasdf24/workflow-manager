# workflow-manager
Save and open a set of windows and web sites at a glance. 
It saves you time when you start working. On anything.

# How do I use it?
Run the exe file "Workflow Manager.exe".
When the console opens you can see 6 menu options.
Click the 2nd option in order to create your'e first workflow:)
Set the name of the workflow and then add some paths of everything you want: files, folders, websites...
when you done, type -1.
Now just write the name of the workflow, and all of the paths will be open for you.

# Where is the data saved?
The data is saved to a separate .db file in the same directory, so when you move the .exe file, a new and empty .db 
file will be created.

# Dependencis:
- Python 3.6
- sqlite3
- urlib

Just make sure those three are exist, although they already should be in the python's API.

# PULL REQUEST:
This software is simple but very useful for day to day use, so if you have any idea for making it better than it is now, make your'e changes and send a pull request. I'm waiting to see what new features you will add to this project!
